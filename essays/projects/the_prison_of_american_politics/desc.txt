The first essay I wrote in 2020. It took me a very long time, but really crystalized after Jan 6 2021. This essay represents the starting point for my articulation of an intution about the American Political System that I am still exploring. At the moment I am working on updating this idea with a lot more of the specific theoretical and historical context I have researchd since finishing the essay.
