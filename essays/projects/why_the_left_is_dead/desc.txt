This essay is the more developed of my follow-ups to "The Prison of American Politics". The critique of liberalism I lay out here has expanded into a more general interest in history and social/cultural development ovre time. This was mostly drawing from my experiences and memories after having been a daily left-wing political consumer for over a decade. It's a direct critique of the Left and Progressivism, but a similar critique and the dynamics laid out here translate well to the poltical system more generally.
