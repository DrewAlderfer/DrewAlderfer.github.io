                <p>This was a long term project that let me help develop and iterate on a manufacturing process.</p>

                <p>Some of the pieces we made were one offs (the reception desk), or built for a specific space (the steel-perf wall), but we made several hundred of the rolling racks.</p>

                <p>I was involved in figuring out and executing every step of the process: protoyping, designing permament fixtures, welding, finishing, CNC, delivery and installations.</p>

            <h4>Reception Counter</h4>
            <p>Process shots of building a reception counter. It was a relatively complicated build as the counter needed to sleeve over an existing cooler unit. I worked out the design of the tubing and component parts for this build in addition to leading the physical build. It was finished by clading it with steel sheet, and then the whole thing was powder coated.</p>
