            <p>This project was a self directed EDA and data processing project using the 
            Python Pandas library and a collection of datasets from IMDB (the Internet Movie 
            Database) and a few other similar sources. The Intention of the project is to 
            discover, analyze and use patterns and relationships found in the provided 
            datasets to make business recommendations according to the following prompt.</p>

            <h4>Business Understanding</h4>

            <p>The client, Microsoft, has decided to explore getting involved in the 
            entertainment industry. Specifically, they are interested in making movies. I have 
            been task with examining the provided data and making three recommendations for 
            how to successfully enter the entertainment industry as a large, established 
            company currently operating in a different industry.</p>

            <p>Some questions I attempted to answer with this dataset were: * What types of 
            movies are succesful in today's market * What patterns and trends can be gleaned 
            from the dataset * Given the observable business environment, what practical 
            advice would I provide a client about entering the industry</p>

            <h4>Data Understanding</h4>

            <p>The source for the data used was a publicly licensed sql database provided by 
            the website IMDB. The database contained 8 tables: table names</p>

            <img src="projects/IMDB_analysis/images/imdb_001.png"></img>

            <p>I started off the EDA process by pulling these table out of the sql database 
            and storing them in Pandas DataFrame objects oragnized within a python dict 
            object. I was then able to start observing the structure of and relationships 
            between the tables and begin the process of analyzing there meaning.</p>

            <h4>Visualizations</h4>

            <p>I started by visualizing the total box office grosses for each of the top 
            genres.</p>

            <h4>Total Box Office by Genre</h4>

            <img src="projects/IMDB_analysis/images/imdb_002.png"></img>

            <p>Then I decided to compare the median production budget by each of these 
            genres.</p>

            <h4>Median Production Budgets</h4>

            <img src="projects/IMDB_analysis/images/imdb_003.png"></img>

            <p>and the distribution within each genre of ratings vs 
            budget:</p>

            <h4>Ratings per Million Spent</h4>

            <img src="projects/IMDB_analysis/images/imdb_004.png"></img>

            <p>After identifying that Action and Drama commanded the largest market share 
            among the various genres, I wanted to compare the distribution of the that market 
            share within each repsectively.</p>

            <h4>Action Genre Market Distribution</h4>

            <h4>Drama Genre Market Distribution</h4>
