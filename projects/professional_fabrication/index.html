                <h5>Table for Coworking Space</h5>

                <p>This was a table I helped build and install in a coworking space in Brooklyn. I did
                some of the welding (aluminum, both tig and spool gun) a lot of the metal work, and some
                of the carpentry finishes and lamination. I also worked on the install. I still
                really like the design. This was while I was freelancing and the shop I was working 
                for does a lot of really cool work.</p>
